Welcome to my webpage about deer!

<h1>Here is some information about deer:</h1>

    According to Wikipedia.org, "Deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming
	the family Cervidae. The two main groups are the Cervinae, including
	the muntjac, the elk (wapiti), the fallow deer and the chital, and the
	Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou), the roe deer and the
	moose. Female reindeer, and male deer of all species (except the
	Chinese water deer), grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they
	differ from permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different
	family (Bovidae) within the same order of even-toed ungulates
	(Artiodactyla)." 
	
	<h3>Here is a list of some types of deer that I can think of off the top of my head:</h3>
	<!--Below is an example of an unordered list in xhtml-->
	<ul>
	   <li>white tailed deer</li>
	   <li>reindeer</li>
	   <li>chinese water deer</li>
	   <li>mule deer</li>
	   <li>roe deer</li>
	</ul>
	<br></br>
	I decided to include information about deer because it was the first thing
	I thought of to write about. Here is a table representing how many deer I saw last week: 
	<br></br>
	<!--Below is an example of a table in xhtml-->
	<table>
	<th>Deer I saw last week</th>
	<tr>
	   <td>Monday</td>
	   <td>2</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
        <td>Tuesday</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
	<tr>
        <td>Wednesday</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Thursday</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Friday</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Saturday</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
